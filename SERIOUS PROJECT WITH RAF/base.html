    <h4><u> Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)</u></h4>
    <br>
    <p>Battery Electric Vehicles, also called BEVs and more frequently called EVs, are fully electric vehicles with rechargeable batteries and no gasoline engine. All energy to run the vehicle comes from the battery pack which is recharged from the grid. BEVs are zero emissions vehicles, as they do not generate any harmful tailpipe emissions or air pollution hazards caused by traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.</p>

    <br>
     <p>In Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) all the energy required to run the electric motor comes from the battery pack. Use of gasoline is absent. Therefore, they emit zero emissions and are eco-friendly. They do not need a reduction gearbox. The battery can be charged from 10% to 80% in around 30 minutes with DC fast charging.  </p>
      <br>
      <br>
     <h4>ADVANTAGES</h4>
     <ul>
        <li>They are quiet. Since, there is no internal combustion noise.</li>
        <li>Safe to operate and charge</li>
        <li>Eco-friendly</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4>DISADVANTAGES</h4>
     <ul>
        <li>Not ideal for long distance drive</li>
        <li>Charging time can take up to hours</li>
        <li>Difficult to locate charging stations</li>
     </ul>

        <br>
        <p> Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles, or PHEVs, have both an engine and electric motor to drive the car. Like regular hybrids, they can recharge their battery through regenerative braking. They differ from regular hybrids by having a much larger battery, and being able to plug into the grid to recharge. While regular hybrids can (at low speed) travel 1-2 miles before the gasoline engine turns on, PHEVs can go anywhere from 10-40 miles before their gas engines provide assistance. Once the all-electric range is depleted, PHEVs act as regular hybrids, and can travel several hundred miles on a tank of gasoline. All PHEVs can charge at an EVgo L2 charger, but most PHEVs are not capable of supporting fast charging</p>

        <br>
         <p>Beyond battery storage and motor power, there are various ways to combine the power from the electric motor and the engine. The two main configurations are parallel and series. Some PHEVs use transmissions that allow them to operate in either parallel or series configurations, switching between the two based on the drive profile.

            Parallel hybrid operation connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling. Both the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly.
            
            Series plug-in hybrids use only the electric motor to drive the wheels. The internal combustion engine is used to generate electricity for the motor. Vehicles of this type are often referred to as extended-range electric vehicles. The electric motor drives the wheels almost all of the time, but the vehicle can switch to work like a parallel hybrid at highway speeds when the battery is depleted.</p>
